# Dynamic Contact Book

This project is a dynamic contact book application built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). It was developed as part of my internship at Codsoft to learn GUI development, data handling, and file I/O operations in Python.

## Overview

The Dynamic Contact Book allows users to manage their contacts through a graphical interface. It supports adding new contacts, viewing existing contacts, searching for specific contacts, updating contact information, and deleting contacts. Contacts are stored persistently using file I/O operations, ensuring that data is retained between sessions.

## Features

- **GUI with Tkinter:** Provides an intuitive and interactive interface for managing contacts.
- **Add Contacts:** Allows users to add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, and email address.
